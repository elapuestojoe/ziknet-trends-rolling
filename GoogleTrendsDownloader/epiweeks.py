# An epidemiological week, commonly referred to as an epi week or a CDC week, 
# is simply a standardized method of counting weeks to allow for the comparison of data year after year.
# Definition
# The first epi week of the year ends, by definition, on the first Saturday of January, 
# as long as it falls at least four days into the month. Each epi week begins on a Sunday 
# and ends on a Saturday.
